#### Commenting Features
When on a video page, you can comment on the video, or reply to other users' comments.
- Commenting on the video

Just below the video description, you can find a box that says `Add your comment here`. If you click on the box, it will turn into a text input box and you can write your comment. To submit the comment, simply click on `Submit` once you've finished writing. Alternatively, you can click on `Cancel` if you want to discard your comment.
- Replying to another comment

When you see comments from other users, there is a `REPLY` tag right under each of their comments. Simply click on it to write a response. Note that all replies are grouped into one thread based on the comment directly to the video. This is the same style as the YouTube website.

### Registration Features
Either from the home page, or any video page, you can find a navigation bar at the top of the browser. From there, you can Register for an account for our website, or log in.
- Register

Signing up is super easy! Simply pick a user name, choose a password, and fill in your email address (for password recovery). The password requires at least 6 characters, but we won't force you to have at least 1 number or anything like that! In case the process failed, such as the username is taken, you will see an error message explaining what went wrong.
- Log in

Once registered, you will automatically log in and see the nagivation bar change, with a personalized greeting message. For future visits, you can simply enter your username and password to log in.
- Password Recovery

Whenever you entered a wrong password, you will be prompted to recover your password. The process starts from entering your email address. A reset code will be sent to your email, and you will need that code along with your new password to finish the reset process.

#### Registered User Features
As a registered user, you will have a few more features available.
- Voting

Like a comment? Dislike a comment? Simply click on the thumbs up or down icon to cast your vote. Note that your vote will only count once, and repeated voting will undo your previous vote.

Didn't quite like the comment you've posted before? You can edit what you've said, or delete it completely. Note that if you edit your comment, other users will be able to notice from the timestamp (of your last edit). Deleted comments will simply say `Deleted comment`. Once a comment is deleted, it cannot be edited again.
